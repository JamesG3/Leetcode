'''
Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:

The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.

Solution: Stack, Greedy
Time, Space = O(n)
