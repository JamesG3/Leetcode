# Leetcode
- This repository is created to save my answers and drafts while i was practicing on LeetCode.
- All answers is written with Python, which is my favorite language.
- Every *.py* file contains the answer, and a short description of what the question talked about. I also wrote comment for every important step in the code in order to help me to refresh my memory quickly.
