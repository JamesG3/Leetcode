'''
Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().

Solution: Design, iterator implemtation
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
